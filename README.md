A content checking application made via Flask. This application uses Smith Waterman algorithm for checking the similarity between contents. The methods are fairly static and the algorithm itself is not very suitable for checking the plagiarism as it has no way of analysing at semantic level and the accuracy is calculated as per the sequence match in the two sets of data. It is a project done for learning purpose. Currently only works for .txt formatted file as input.
